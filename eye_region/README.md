# OpenFace Eye Region

This package is a small extension to the [ROS 2 wrapper for OpenFace](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/ros2_openface) that provides extraction of eye regions based on the detected OpenFace facial landmarks.

Node `openface_eye_region` requires `openface_separate` to be running with *2D visible features* enabled.
